********************************************************


We work hard to ensure that **circtools** is a powerful tool empowering your research. However, no software is free of bugs and issues, therefore we would love to get feedback from our users.

Report issues
--------------

There are different options file an issues with out circRNA related software. Whenever possible please try to provide as much information as possible - this help to quickly assess the problem and fix it. Especially helpful are

* Software versions used
* Log files
* The command line used to call the software
* Sample data files in order to reproduce the error
* Temporary files that may contain pointers to fix the issues
